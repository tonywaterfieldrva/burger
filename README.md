# Burger Loggerr App

The objective of this assignment is to create a burger tracker/log application using a MySQL database with Node to store, query and route data, Express, and Handlebars to generate the HTML page while using the MVC (Model, View, Controller) design.

The finished application will be deployed on Heroku

Several burgers will be in the Ready to Order section panel on the left.  The user can also Make  a Burger by entering the name in the Jumbotron header section.  Once the new user created burger is submitted it will move to the Order Burger section.  In the Order Burger section when the user clicks the Order to Eat button, the selected Burger will move over to the Eat Your Burger panel on right.  When the user selects the Done Eat'n It button the Burger will be removed from the panel and deleted from the database.  The number preceeding the Burger name in each panel is the MySQL ID (primary key)
